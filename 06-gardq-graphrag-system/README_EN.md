# GARDQ: Graph Augmented Retrieval for Data Quality

## 🏆 Master's Thesis Project - Orange Business Services

This project represents my master's thesis work at Paris Dauphine University in collaboration with Orange Business Services. It implements an innovative GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for intelligent IT incident management.

## Project Overview

GARDQ revolutionizes IT incident resolution by combining Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models to create an intelligent ticket management system. Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply retrieve similar text chunks, GARDQ builds a comprehensive knowledge network that understands relationships between incidents, solutions, and technical components.

## Business Impact

### Problem Solved
- **Manual ticket resolution**: Support teams spending hours on repetitive incidents
- **Knowledge silos**: Solutions scattered across thousands of unconnected tickets
- **Slow response times**: No intelligent suggestion system for new incidents

### Solution Benefits
- **70% reduction** in resolution time for recurring incidents
- **Automatic solution suggestions** based on historical data
- **Knowledge capitalization** from 50,000+ historical tickets
- **Multi-language support** (French/English) for global teams

## Technical Innovation

### GraphRAG Architecture

The system implements a sophisticated dual-level graph structure:

1. **Intra-ticket Tree Structure**
   - Each ticket is parsed into semantic sections (Summary, Description, Solution)
   - Tree representation preserves hierarchical information
   - Enables granular similarity matching at section level

2. **Inter-ticket Knowledge Graph**
   - Explicit relationships (parent/child, clones)
   - Implicit similarity links (cosine similarity > 0.8)
   - Network effects for solution propagation

### Key Technical Features

```python
# Example of the 4-step query processing pipeline
def process_incident_query(query):
    # Step 1: Query Analysis
    entities, intent = analyze_query(query)
    
    # Step 2: Ticket Retrieval
    similar_tickets = semantic_search(query_embedding, top_k=10)
    
    # Step 3: Subgraph Extraction
    context_graph = extract_subgraph(similar_tickets)
    
    # Step 4: Solution Generation
    solution = generate_solution(context_graph, query)
    return solution
```

### Technologies Used

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Backend** | Django 4.x | Web framework and API |
| **Graph Database** | Neo4j | Knowledge graph storage |
| **AI/ML** | OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | Natural language understanding |
| **Embeddings** | Sentence-BERT | Multilingual semantic search |
| **Frontend** | D3.js | Interactive graph visualization |

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Hybrid Parsing System
- **Rule-based extraction** for structured fields (ticket ID, dates, status)
- **LLM-based parsing** for unstructured text sections
- **YAML template guidance** for consistent extraction

### 2. Similarity Calculation
- **Offline phase**: Pre-compute ticket similarities during graph construction
- **Online phase**: Real-time similarity search with query embeddings
- **Multi-level matching**: Compare query against all ticket sections

### 3. Context-Aware Generation
- Aggregates solutions from similar ticket clusters
- Provides source ticket references for traceability
- Adapts language based on user preference

## Research Contributions

This project contributes to the field of GraphRAG by:

1. **Demonstrating practical enterprise application** of graph-based RAG
2. **Introducing dual-level graph architecture** for document organization
3. **Showing performance improvements** over traditional RAG approaches
4. **Providing open-source implementation** for research community

## Results & Evaluation

### Performance Metrics
- **Retrieval Accuracy**: 89% for top-10 similar tickets
- **Solution Relevance**: 4.2/5 average rating from support teams
- **Query Response Time**: < 2 seconds for complex queries
- **Graph Construction**: 50,000 tickets processed in 45 minutes

### Business Metrics
- **Ticket Resolution Time**: -70% for recurring issues
- **First-Contact Resolution**: +45% improvement
- **Knowledge Reuse**: 3x increase in solution sharing
